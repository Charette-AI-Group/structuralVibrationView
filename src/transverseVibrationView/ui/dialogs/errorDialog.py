r"""One place failures are shown, because the status bar is not that place.

The bar holds a single line and elides whatever will not fit. The part of a
failure that says *why* - the path, the setting, the thing to check next -
sits at the end, so the bar drops exactly the half worth reading and leaves
something that looks like the whole message. In the app this came from, that
hid a diagnosis three times before it was fixed here.

So a failure opens a dialog carrying the whole text, selectable so it can be
copied into a message to somebody else, and the bar gets a short honest
headline. The bar is for status; this is for failures.
